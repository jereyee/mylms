<h2 id="project-justification">Project Justification</h2>
<p>This project has features inspired by the previous projects (i.e. search bar in 'wiki', post updates in 'network'), but it carries its own distinction and a wider complexity. The distinguishing features include, but are not exclusive to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delegated user roles with specific permissions (teacher, student, admin)</li>
<li>Uploading of files (resources, submissions page)</li>
<li>Asynchronous deletion of files (resources page)</li>
<li>Notification system (notifications page)</li>
<li>Embedding external videos (lessons page)</li>
<li>Assignment-tracking (assignments page)</li>
<li>Mobile-responsiveness</li>
</ol>
<p>It utilizes 10 Django models, with numerous Many-To-Many fields. It also employs datetime formatting, with a JavaScript datepicker to set the deadline of assignments. In terms of UI, it was designed for a simple look/feel, with seamless navigation between the different parts. Interrelating multiple components and user-types to create a functioning Learning Management System thus gives shape to the intricate complexity of this project.</p>
